This is a port of Tamalib by JCRona to Dragonball CPU-based Palm OS devices.

This software was developed using [CodeWarrior IDE v5.12.1283](https://palmdb.net/app/codewarrior) and tested using a combination of the POSE emulator, [CloudPilot emulator](https://cloudpilot-emu.github.io/), and an actual Palm IIIx.

Lots of omissions had to be made to TamaLib in order to get it to (somewhat) run on the target hardware.
Performance is still quite bad, likely due to the speed of the drawing operations.
Not all features are implemented.
